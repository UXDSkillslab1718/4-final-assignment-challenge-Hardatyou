          <p>I met some new friends back then.</p>

          <!-- School 2 details. -->
          <h3>Secondary Shool "Sveti Ivan Rilski" - Haskovo</h3>
          <p>Yes, I studied in the sames school but thats how things are working in Bulgaria.</p>

          <!-- School 3 details. -->
          <h3>High School "Aleksandar Paskalev" - Haskovo</h3>

          <h3>Itroduction to User Experience</h3>
          <p>One of the most intensive courses that we had in the first module.</p>
          <img class="example" src="images/iux-example.png" alt="IUX Example">
          <p>For this course, we had to choose one product and elaborate over the products usability factors.</p>

          <!-- Project 2 details. -->
          <h3>Research for Design</h3>
          <p>Actually, to be fair, reseach for design was on pair with IUX when it comes to difficulty <br>
            but mainly because it required us to actually find someone and interview him while we are giving him <br>
            certein tasks to do.</p>

            <!-- Project 3 details. -->
            <h3 class="marginadjust">Intercultural Competence</h3>
            <p>This was probably one of the best courses that we had on the first module.</p>
            <img class="example" src="images/ic-example.png" alt="Intercultural competence example">
            <p>The course helped the whole class to get to know eachother with all kinds of different mini-games <br>
              and tasks that we had to do in groups.</p>

          <h3>Design And Creativity</h3>
          <p>Design and creativity was one of a kind course that we had on our first modude. <br>
              I still remember how fun and yet stressful it was for me while I was doing the <br>
              assignments (I was still being on my first module after all).</p>
          <h4>Sketches from my trip to Linz</h4>
          <img class="topproject-images" src="images/dc-firstiteration.jpg" alt="Sketches from my trip to Linz">
          <p>These sketches were made while I was still at Linz in order to help me create one of the following up assignment that we had.</p>

          <!-- TopProject 2 details. -->
          <h4>My Linz trip experience assignment</h4>
          <img class="topproject-images" src="images/dc-seconditeration.jpg" alt="Trip to Linz final assignment">
          <p>The trip to Linz left me with some good memories which also came in handy when I had to create one of the assignments<br>
              which was, to express the trip to Linz in a drawing.</p>
